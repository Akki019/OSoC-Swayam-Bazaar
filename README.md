### About the Project
> This web application aims to connect users with local vendors in their area, allowing them to purchase groceries and other goods directly from these vendors. Unlike the existing local application called City Mall, which doesn't offer the option to buy from specific shops, this application will enable users to select the shops they prefer. The main goal is to establish a direct connection between users and local shops for purchasing goods. For instance, if a user wants to buy flour from a particular local shop that isn't a well-known brand but offers high-quality and affordable flour, this application will assist them in doing so. To address the challenge of gathering a comprehensive dataset, we propose a solution where shopkeepers themselves can input their goods into the application. This approach is similar to how Google Maps allows users to add new places they discover to the database. In summary, the application will have two separate logins: one for users and another for shopkeepers.
